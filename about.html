        Photographs are a way of preserving a moment in our lives for the rest of our lives. Many of us have at least
        been tempted at the flashy array of photo printers which seemingly leap off the shelves at even the least
        tech-savvy. It surely seems old fashioned to talk about 35mm film and non-digital cameras in today’s day and
        age. To our children, cameras not so feature rich with LCD screens and built in Wi-Fi is as foreign as Atari.
        However, the innovation of home photo printing is bringing about a new way of preserving our most precious
        memories. Not only do we have digital copies to keep with us for the rest of our days across hundreds of
        different archives.
